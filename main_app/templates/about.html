<h1>About the Sounds Good</h1>
<hr />
<p class="page-container">
  Every song expresses some kind of emotion, whether that be one single emotion or a mix, so you can gather songs with similar emotions and put them into a playlist. Some examples of emotions that you can create a playlist around are nostalgia, love, loneliness, hope, fear, happiness, sadness, regret, passion, and so on.
